# [Project 1: Classification with Python - Forest Fires Data Set](https://github.com/ericmattos/Forest-Fires-Classification)

This is a classification project using Python and a data set on Algerian forest fires. Our goal was to use different machine learning algorithms to predict, based on the atmospheric conditions of a given day, whether or not there will be a forest fire, we then compared the accuracies of different classifiers to determine which one is best suited for this problem. The algorithms we tested were the naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest, k nearest neighbors, logistic regression, support vector machines and neural networks classifiers. The ones with the best performance were the decision tree and neural networks classifiers, which were not statistically distinct from each others according to the Tukey test.

# [Project 2: Classification with Python - Titanic Data Set](https://github.com/ericmattos/Titanic-Classification)

This is a classification project using Python and the Titanic data set. Our goal was to use different machine learning algorithms to predict which passengers survived and compare the results to determine which algorithm is best suited for this problem. The algorithms we tested were the naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest, k nearest neighbors, logistic regression, support vector machines and neural networks classifiers. The ones with the best performance were decision tree, random forest and logistic regression and the results for these three algorithms were not statistically distinct from each other.

# [Project 3: Regression with Python - Bike Sharing Data Set](https://github.com/ericmattos/Bike-Sharing-Regression)

This is a regression project using Python and a data set containing information about bicycle rentals, weather conditions and holiday dates. Our goal was to use this data set to compare different regression algorithms and find which one performs best at predicting how many bicycles will be rented in a given day, taking into account time of the year, day of the week, temperature, among other features. The algorithms we tested were linear regression, polynomial linear regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, support vector regression and neural network regression

# [Project 4: Clustering with Python - Heart Failure Data Set](https://github.com/ericmattos/Heart-Failure-Clustering)

This is a clustering project using Python on a data set of patients that suffered from heart failure. Our goal was to use different clustering algorithms to separate the patients into groups, according to their ejection fraction and level of serum creatinine, then compare the results. The tested algorithms were k-means, hierarchical clustering and DBSCAN (Density Based Spacial Clustering of Applications with Noise). The first two led to very similar clusters, with 5 groups, while the later led to 7 groups (plus the unassigned entries).

# [Project 5: Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL - Meteorite Data Set](https://github.com/ericmattos/Meteorite-Exploratory-Data-Analysis)

This is an exploratory data analysis project using SQL on a data set of meteorite landings.  Our goal was to extract information from this data set using MySQL. We used our knowledge of SQL tables, queries, subqueries, aggregate functions, CTEs and temporary tables to determine the heaviest and second heaviest meteorites, to find the oldest and second oldest of them, to label them based on how their mass compared with the average, to calculate the number of meteorites that fell in each year and to determine the percentage of meteorites that fell in each year over the course of a ten year period.
